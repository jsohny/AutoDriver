#### Setup:
- Make sure you unzip the ```dataset.zip``` folder
- Also, run the following in the root directory in order to get the visualization tool: ```https://github.com/interaction-dataset/interaction-dataset```
##### To visualize the data:
- change directories into the ```scripts``` folder
- determine which ```.csv``` you want to visualize - it should be one of the ones inside ```dataset\DR_USA_Intersection_MA\<train or test>```
- run ```python3 run_vis.py "path/to/csv_file.csv"```
- this will do all the copying/sorting/modifying of the csv for you, then launch the visualization tool.
